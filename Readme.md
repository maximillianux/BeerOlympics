# Games

## 1st Round - Chug Relay

What better way to kick off a Beer Olympics than a good, old fashioned, chug relay?

Two rounds
winners of the first round face off for 1st and 2nd
losers of the 1st round face off for 3rd and 4th.
>I understand that this would make 2nd and 3rd have the same record. That makes the 1st round that much more important.

## How to Play
This should be pretty self explanatory but two teams will face off at a table, red solo cup infant of each person, filled to the top line. When someone yells “Go”, the first person of each team will grab their cup and chug until it’s gone. When it is gone that person has to put their empty cup on the table and then the next person can grab their cup. Players may not touch their cup until it is their turn to chug. This continues through the full team. If a team is unbalanced, then one person on the smaller team has to go twice.

### Fouls
Excessive spillage will result in seconds being added on, whatever is fair to the amount of spillage

### How to Win
One team finishes their drinks before the other team

Point System
Two rounds
winners of the first round face off for 1st and 2nd
losers of the 1st round face off for 3rd and 4th.

## 2nd Round - Beer Die - Teams Split into Pairs

Each pair will play 3 rounds of this game and records will be added together to determine that place of each team

### Setup
1 cup in each corner filled up to the top.
1 team on each side
1 die

### Getting Started
Each team roles the die, highest number goes first

### How to Play
This goes back and forth like beer pong.
#### Offense
Team throws lofts (has to be a high toss) the die into the air and tries to land it in the opposite team’s cups.
#### Defense
If the dice hits the table and falls off, the other team has to catch the dice before it hits the ground. This will result in a point for the offensive team if the dice hits the ground

### Scoring and Drinking
- 3 points for a sink
    - Chug cup where die landed
- 2 points if its hits a cup and it hits the ground
    - Two drinks
- 1 point when it hits the cup
    - One drink
- 1 point if it hits the table and the other team doesn’t catch it
    - One drink

- Nothing happens if the dice stays on the table or if the defensive team catches it

### Special Rules
Anytime the dice is on 5 and someone calls it out by saying “bizz” the other team has to drink.

### How to Win
First team to 9 points wins

### Video
This video has extra rules, we are just going to keep it simple though.

## 3rd Round - Boom/Slam Cup

### Setup
- Make a circle of cups in the center of the table. Each table should have 18.
-  Fill the drinking cups about one-third full of beer.
-  In the center of the circle of cups file one cup all the way up, this is the death cup
-  Get out two more cups and set those closer to the edge for the game to start
-  Get two ping pong balls to play with
- Two tables are put together and teammates cannot stand by each other

### How to Play
- Everyone stands in a circle around the table.
- Two players grab a cup, cheers, drink, and play. 
- Two players begin trying to bounce their ball in the cup in front of them. There are two possible outcomes:
	- If you make it in on the first try, you can pass the ball and cup to anyone in the circle.
	- If you make it in on a later try, you must pass the ball and cup to the right.
-  If the person directly to your left bounces their ball into his or her cup before you, then the person to your left will stack the cup on yours. You will have to drink one of the cups from the middle of the table and start again as soon as you’re done drinking. The person the the right of who got stacked automatically starts after they get stacked.
- If a person accidentally, bounces the ball into a center cup then the game stop, they have to drink the cup the ball went into stack the cups and start the game back up.

### How to Win
- Each player is playing for their team.
- When a player gets stacked twice they are outLast player standing, wins for their team.

- When one team gets a ball in a cup they slide the cup to the opposing player next to them. The opposing player has to chug that drink, then play flip cup before they can start playing again. The other team can continue play while this happens.

## 5th Round - Beer Pong - Teams split into Pairs

Each pair will play 3 rounds of this game and records will be added together to determine that place of each team

### How to Play
I don’t need to explain how this game is played it’s very simple.

### House rules
If a team scores both balls into different cups, balls are given back and those cups are taken out.
If a team scores into the same cup then its three cups and balls are given back.
If the first cup made for a team, is the middle cup, this is “bitch cup”. The cup gets taken out but that person must kneel until they score into another cup.
You can bounce the ball for two cups but the opposing team can play defense and smack the ball away after a bounce
One re-rack for a game then gentleman’s rule for the last two cups
When shooting your elbows may not go over the table

### How to Win
All cups are scored into and gone before the other team
